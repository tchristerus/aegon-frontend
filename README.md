The Aegon calculator is an assessment given by Aegon. This repo is contains the front-end required to run the
calculator.

## Deadline issues :)

Due to the deadline I was not able to finish the unit tests for the front-end. For that reason I am going to describe
what I should have done when I had more time. First I would mock the httpclient and make sure that the results match the
back-end.
